# Pokemon: An Analysis of Strength and Realism Using Pokedex Data

## About
This project explores a dataset containing statistics on the Pokemon video game characters up to the 8th generation (last updated October 2020). We asked two types of questions within our data set. The first three questions are concentrated on measures of a Pokemon's strength, while the last two are focused on a Pokemon's realism.

We concentrated on asking these questions.

1. For each Pokemon Type, what percent of Pokemon with that Type as its primary type have a damage multiplier against Bug Type Moves that is greater than 1?
2. or Pokemon whose Total Stat Points are in groups of 50 (0 - 50, 51 -100, â€¦), how many have a catch rate less than the average for all Pokemon?
3. For pokemon in generation 5, as global number increases, does health follow an upward trend?
4. What is the correlation between speed and weight in kg?
5. For each Pokemon and dogs of similar height, what is the weight difference between them?

Full Analysis is available in the Final_Report_LAM_AR.ipynb file.
